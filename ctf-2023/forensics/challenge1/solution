# Investigate the xls and extract information.

#1. Load the xls to viper

viper > update-modules
viper > open -f staff_info.xls
viper > find all
viper > sessions -l 
viper staff_info.xls > office -v
viper > office -e /htf

# ALternative -> olevba to extract the VB script

olevba staff_info.xls

#2. Understand the code. I used chatgpt to understand the code.

The VBA code is malicious and designed to download and execute additional code on the victim's computer.

Upon opening the Excel workbook, the macro calls the ilsqleepkodh subroutine. This subroutine initializes a string variable iesjxryuarznqnn by concatenating two encoded strings, which together form a URL pointing to a malicious website.

The jgepjdbdud function creates an HTTP request to the URL specified in the iesjxryuarznqnn variable and sends it along with a command output parameter. The response from the server is then returned as a string value.

The srahstpvf function returns a string containing the name of the user's computer and domain.

Finally, the qzycnajrfnguwvha function combines the output from the srahstpvf function and a command output parameter and passes it to the jgepjdbdud function. The response from the server is then returned as a string value.

The macro appears to be designed to download and execute additional code on the victim's computer by making a request to a remote server and then executing the returned code. It is not possible to determine the full extent of the malware's capabilities without further analysis of the downloaded code.

# Put the entire code in https://onecompiler.com/vb/  and analyse.

#3. Extract the piece of code that posts to the malicous site.
I thought the response would be the HTB flag, but the request itself had it :)

# Got the HTB code

# Another easiest way to get is via wireshark, but need to open the excel and allow the macro to run.
